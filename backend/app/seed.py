# Maintenance Work Order WO-10421
Date: 2025-08-14
Asset: P-101 Condensate Transfer Pump in Unit A
Technician recorded high vibration and seal failure on P-101. ALM-VIB-HI was active for 4 hours.
Action: isolated pump, replaced mechanical seal, aligned coupling, lubricated bearing kit, verified seal flush.
Root cause note: possible shaft misalignment after prior outage and low suction pressure causing cavitation.
Spare parts: mechanical seal, bearing kit, gasket set.

# Maintenance Work Order WO-10877
Date: 2026-02-19
Asset: P-101 Condensate Transfer Pump, Unit A
Repeated vibration and seal failure observed. Operator reported intermittent cavitation noise and suction strainer fouling.
Action: cleaned suction strainer, replaced mechanical seal, pressure tested flush line, verified alignment.
Reliability engineer requested RCA for repeated seal failure.

# SOP-MECH-014 Pump Isolation and Seal Replacement
Revision: 7
Applies to: P-101, P-102 and centrifugal process pumps
Before opening pump casing, technician must lock out stored energy, drain process fluid, verify zero pressure, and confirm seal flush isolation.
Safety hazards: line break, stored energy, hot work when coupling guard modification is required.
Regulatory references: OSHA-1910.147 and ISO-14224.
